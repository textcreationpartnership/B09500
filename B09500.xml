            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVHEREAS it hath been of abſolute Neceſſity, that a
certain Number of men ſhould be Impreſſed, for the Service of Their
Majeſties, in Defence of this their Province, both at Sea and Land, againſt
the common Enemy. And that ſome perſons imployed therein, have paſſed
the Bounds of their Duty, and my Order, by putting the ſame in Execution in a
violent and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly manner, to the great Grievance of Their Majeſties
good Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For preventing ſuch Diſorders for the future, and
rendring to all injured Perſons due Satisſaction, I do hereby Publiſh and
Declare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THat as ſuch violent and undue methods have been uſed
without my Knowledge, and to my great Diſturbance, there ſhall be effectual
care taken, that ſuch as have received Damage thereby, ſhall Be Relieved,
and all thoſe that have been the occaſion thereof ſhall be ſeverely
puniſhed.</p>
            <p>And all people whatſoever are to take notice, that no perſon
ſhall hereafter be Preſt into their Majeſties Service, but by a
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Warrant to the Military Officers, or Conſtables, for that
Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And if any ſhall preſume to Act contrary to their Duty upon
any ſuch occaſion, all Juſtices of the Peace and all Officers Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
and Civil, are Required in the Name of their Majeſties to cauſe them to be
Seized, and Secured, in order to their being puniſhed, according to the
utmoſt ſeverity of the Law.</p>
            <p>And whereas divers Souldiers Entered in their Majeſties
Service and Pay, have preſumed to leave their Poſts, and ſome have out
ſtaid their Paſs, without leave from their Commanders, others Impreſt for
their Majeſties Service, have abſented and not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared according to
Order.</p>
            <p>I do therefore Order and ſtrictly Command, all ſuch
Souldiers, forthwith to Repair unto their Reſpective Poſts, and Duty, as
they will anſwer their Neglect at their Peril, and all Officers Military and
Civil, that ſhall know, or be informed of any ſuch Deſerters or Runaway
Soldiers, are to cauſe them to be taken up, and conveyed before the next
Juſtice of the Peace, in order to their being Returned, and ſent unto their
Reſpective Officers, and every Juſtice of the Peace, is hereby Impowred and
Required to deal effectually, in this matter; and no Soldier may preſume to
leave his Poſt, or abſent himſelf from his Duty, on pain of being
proceeded againſt with utmoſt ſeverity of Law.</p>
            <p>And whereas a vigorous Endeavour to ſuppreſs the Growth of
Wickedneſs and Prophaneneſs in this Territory, is not onely the way to
obtain the gracious Preſence of Almighty God, without which we can expect no
good Succeſs of our Affairs, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a thing for which Their Majeſties
have given their particular Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>IT is hereby Required, That all the wholſome Laws here in
Force againſt Vices of all kinds, and particularly the Laws againſt
Blaſphemy, Swearing, Curſing, Lying, unlawful Gaming, Sabbath-breaking,
Idleneſs, Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs, and all Nurſeries and Inticements
of ſuch Impietys, be in their Majeſties Name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and impartially
put in Execution. And all Juſtices, of the Peace, Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Tithing men,
or what-ever other Officers, as well Civil as Military, as are therein
concerned, are hereby directed, enjoyned, and in Their Majeſties Name
Required, in this matter to diſcharge the Duty of their places, with all
fidelity, and all ſorts of perſons to conform themſelves accordingly: And
it is hereby ſignified, that upon Complaint made, and proved againſt any
Officers; of having neglected their Duty, the utmoſt mark of Diſpleaſure
